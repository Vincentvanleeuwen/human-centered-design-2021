# Human Centered Design @cmda-minor-web 2021

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->
## Concept

In this project I will be focussing on Closed Captions.
Darice de la Cuba asked us to create a personalized product. Darice has a problem with hearing sound. Therefore I will be trying to make the experience of Closed Captions better for Darice.

There are many things that have to be tested. Does Darice like colors, can she bind them to an emotion, what devices does she use and more.

## Tests
Check out the tests to get a better understanding of what happened inbetween these few weeks while testing.

[First Test](https://github.com/Vincentvanleeuwen/human-centered-design-2021/wiki/Test-Verslag-7-April)

In the first test we mainly tested what kind of emotion she felt with certain font-types. We concluded that we were thinking way to complex for Darice because she likes minimalistic fonts.

[Second Test](https://github.com/Vincentvanleeuwen/human-centered-design-2021/wiki/Test-Verslag-15-April)

In the second test I could conclude that a circle as an equalizer was just not going to work out. It was hard for Darice to understand what the circle was for. Luckily the change of a font-style from regular to bold, or from regular to italic was doing a positive feedback on Darice. She understood it ment a word would be spoken more loudly than the other words.
Darice liked seeing what kind of music was being played and enjoyed that each person had their own color and name. What she again didn't like was the visualisation of the equalizer. She said she would like it best if it was somewhere in the bottom right.
I also tested how she'd react at emoticons. She liked the way I added the emoticons. Whenever someones face wasn't visible I added one emoticon, this gave her a better idea of what emotional load a sentence had.
Lastly she instantly knew she did not want words jumping in one by one. So I know I can stay away from that.

[Last Test](https://github.com/Vincentvanleeuwen/human-centered-design-2021/wiki/Test-Verslag-21-April)

In the last test I tested a couple variations of the equalizer again. This time she had absolutely no negative feedback. She liked the first and second equalizer. As long as they were top-sided equalizers.
In this test she also mentioned she'd probably rather not see emoticons in Closed Captions. Only with podcasts she seemed to like the emoticons.

## Final Concept

The final concept will be a video element using WebVTT to create customized Closed Captions. With Javascript I added an equalizer to the video.

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- How about a license here? 📜 (or is it a licence?) 🤷 -->
