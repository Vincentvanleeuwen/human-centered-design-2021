# Human Centered Design @cmda-minor-web 2021

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->
## Concept

In this project I will be focussing on Closed Captions.
Darice de la Cuba asked us to create a personalized product. Darice has a problem with hearing sound. Therefore I will be trying to make the experience of Closed Captions better for Darice.

There are many things that have to be tested. Does Darice like colors, can she bind them to an emotion, what devices does she use and more.

## Exclusive Design Principles

### Study situation

When you're designing for someone you have to start by researching what problems the person experiences. In the case of Darice it's to find out what is actually missing when you're deaf. The best way of finding out is to try and feel how it would be for yourself. For Instance you could put on a headset, turn off the volume and watch a video. Is there anything you're missing?

### Ignore conventions 

When you are exclusively designing for one person you can ignore the conventions set for everyone. This is because when you stay away from conventions, you can make a far more personalised product. In the case of Darice this is very difficult. Darice herself is a front-end developer with a lot of love for accessibility. Therefore each decision I'd make she would think about in the sense of standard conventions.

### Prioritise identy

It's important to understand with who you're really dealing with. The more you know about said person, the better the product can become. It would be really weird to come up with a project that does not even come close to the interests of said person.

### Add nonsense

Last but not least, adding nonsense. Nonsense can make a product more fun. You still have to watch out that you're not putting out too much nonsense, since Darice has difficulty standing away from standard conventions. In the case I'm making for Darice the nonsense element started with an equalizer. Later on I found out that this actually isn't even a nonsense item, since Darice liked the equalizer *a lot* 

## Scenario 

You are sitting at your desk at home. You just finished a movie and want to find a show to watch. 
You open YouTube and search for a trailer of Westworld. Then you click on the video and turn on the english subtitles. The goal of this test is to see if the new subtitles give an enhanced experience of watching the video.

### Questions
- Does the equalizer show a good difference between loud and soft?
- Has the color a good influence on knowing who is speaking at that moment?
- Does showing subtitles by words instead of sentences help making it feel more human?
- Can emoticons be used in subtitles to show emotions when a person's face is not visible while saying it?


## Tests

Check out the tests to get a better understanding of what happened inbetween these few weeks while testing.

[First Test (Dutch)](https://github.com/Vincentvanleeuwen/human-centered-design-2021/wiki/Test-Verslag-7-April)

In the first test we mainly tested what kind of emotion she felt with certain font-types. We concluded that we were thinking way to complex for Darice because she likes minimalistic fonts.

In the second test I could conclude that a circle as an equalizer was just not going to work out. It was hard for Darice to understand what the circle was for. Luckily the change of a font-style from regular to bold, or from regular to italic was doing a positive feedback on Darice. She understood it ment a word would be spoken more loudly than the other words.
Darice liked seeing what kind of music was being played and enjoyed that each person had their own color and name. What she again didn't like was the visualisation of the equalizer. She said she would like it best if it was somewhere in the bottom right.
I also tested how she'd react at emoticons. She liked the way I added the emoticons. Whenever someones face wasn't visible I added one emoticon, this gave her a better idea of what emotional load a sentence had.
Lastly she instantly knew she did not want words jumping in one by one. So I know I can stay away from that.

[Last Test (Dutch)](https://github.com/Vincentvanleeuwen/human-centered-design-2021/wiki/Test-Verslag-21-April)

In the last test I tested a couple variations of the equalizer again. This time she had absolutely no negative feedback. She liked the first and second equalizer. As long as they were top-sided equalizers.
In this test she also mentioned she'd probably rather not see emoticons in Closed Captions. Only with podcasts she seemed to like the emoticons.

## Final Concept

For the final concept I've made subtitles using WebVTT to create customized Closed Captions. With Javascript I added an equalizer to the video.

[Live example](https://closedcaps.netlify.app/)

## Conclusion

WebVTT is an amazing type of file. I can imagine a platform where people can make subtitles, where you can add names, and other elements to subtitles. Lets make the web more accessible for deaf people by having an updated type of subtitle!
